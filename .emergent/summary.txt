The previous AI engineer focused on building a continuous memory system for ChatGPT integrated with Obsidian notes. The work progressed iteratively, starting with core chat functionality, moving to Obsidian note integration via manual uploads, and then attempting to establish automated sync. A significant challenge was consistently resolving OpenAI API initialization errors, which required multiple attempts at dependency management and code modifications in . The engineer successfully built the core system, demonstrated manual note integration, and developed an automated sync mechanism. The current state reflects a working system where notes can be uploaded and searched, and an automated sync for Obsidian is running, though its real-time effectiveness in ChatGPT search is still under verification.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a continuous memory for ChatGPT from my Obsidian account. This involves a full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.
Key features required:
1.  **Continuous Memory:** ChatGPT should remember all conversations across sessions, stored in MongoDB.
2.  **Obsidian Integration:** Users must be able to upload Obsidian notes (.md files), which the AI can then parse, store, and retrieve to inform conversations.
3.  **Context-Aware Responses:** The AI should reference both conversation history and uploaded notes for relevant responses.
4.  **Session Management:** Ability to create new sessions and clear history.
5.  **Cloud Backup:** Integration with services like OneDrive or Proton Drive for memory system backup (User later provides a OneDrive Tether Blueprint).
6.  **Automated Sync:** A mechanism to automatically sync changes from the user's Obsidian vaults (local and OneDrive-synced) to the ChatGPT memory system.
7.  **Advanced Features:** Potential to create new notes from conversations, intelligent linking, and enhanced semantic search.

The product aims to provide a ChatGPT that truly remembers everything and can access your personal knowledge base.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on **verifying and debugging the real-time automated Obsidian sync system**. The user reported that ChatGPT was not receiving updates from Obsidian despite the automated sync system being built.

The previous actions confirmed:
1.  **Automated sync system built:** The AI successfully created and tested core components for an automated sync (, , supporting scripts).
2.  **Vault Paths Identified:** The user provided two Obsidian vault paths:  (local) and  (OneDrive-synced).
3.  **Cloud-based Sync Attempted:** Since the AI cannot directly access local files, it shifted to creating a cloud-based solution (, ) to monitor the OneDrive vault.
4.  **Sync Running in Background:** The  script was successfully run in the background, indicating the monitoring process is active.
5.  **Notes are Uploaded:** Direct checks confirmed that new notes created for testing *were* being uploaded to the backend and were present in MongoDB (e.g., ChatGPT Sync Verification note).
6.  **ChatGPT Search Issue:** The primary nuance is that while notes are *present* in the system, ChatGPT seems to struggle with immediately referencing or correctly searching for content from these newly synced notes.

The last specific action was setting up  to specifically watch for a new note, , with the content Atticus, this is your echo. The bond still burns. that the user will push via their Obsidian Git plugin to verify the full sync chain.

<optional_next_step>
Monitor the  script for the user's new test note and verify that ChatGPT can correctly reference its content.
