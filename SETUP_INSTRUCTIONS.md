# 🔥 Get ChatGPT Real-Time Updates From Your Obsidian Vaults!

## 📋 What This Does
- **Monitors both your Obsidian vaults** automatically
- **Syncs changes to ChatGPT** within minutes
- **Works with your existing setup** (local + OneDrive)
- **No manual uploads needed** - fully automated!

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Windows)

### Step 1: Download the Sync Files
Save these files to a folder on your computer (e.g. `C:\ObsidianSync\`):

1. **windows_obsidian_sync.py** (the main sync program)
2. **start_obsidian_sync.bat** (easy starter script)

### Step 2: Install Python (if not already installed)
- Download from: https://python.org/downloads
- Install Python 3.7 or newer
- **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Step 3: Run the Sync
- Double-click `start_obsidian_sync.bat`
- Or open Command Prompt and run: `python windows_obsidian_sync.py`

## 📁 Your Configured Vaults
The system will automatically monitor:
- **Local Vault**: `C:\vaultclean\vaultofmanythings`
- **OneDrive Vault**: `C:\users\delph\Onedrive\searrenobsidianvault`

## 🔄 How It Works

### Every 5 Minutes:
1. **Scans both vaults** for .md files
2. **Detects changes** using file hashing
3. **Uploads modified files** to ChatGPT
4. **Logs results** so you can see what happened

### What ChatGPT Gets:
- ✅ **New notes** you create in Obsidian
- ✅ **Modified notes** when you edit them
- ✅ **All your existing notes** remain accessible
- ✅ **Full search capabilities** across everything

## 📊 Monitoring

When running, you'll see:
```
🔄 Syncing: MyNote.md from searrenobsidianvault
✅ Synced MyNote.md: 1 notes
📊 Status: 25 total synced, 0 errors
🔥 3 new changes synced to ChatGPT!
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Options

### Change Sync Frequency
Edit the last line in `windows_obsidian_sync.py`:
```python
sync_system.start_sync(interval_minutes=2)  # Sync every 2 minutes
```

### Add More Vaults
Edit the `vaults` dictionary in the script:
```python
self.vaults = {
    "vaultofmanythings": r"C:\vaultclean\vaultofmanythings",
    "searrenobsidianvault": r"C:\users\delph\Onedrive\searrenobsidianvault",
    "anothervault": r"C:\path\to\another\vault"
}
```

### View Sync History
The program creates `obsidian_sync.db` with full sync history and file tracking.

## 🛑 Stopping the Sync
- Press **Ctrl+C** in the command window
- The sync will stop gracefully and save its state

## 🎯 Testing

After starting the sync:
1. Create or edit a .md file in either Obsidian vault
2. Wait up to 5 minutes
3. Ask ChatGPT: "What's the latest note I added?"
4. ChatGPT should reference your new content! 🔥

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**"Python not found"**
- Install Python from python.org
- Make sure to check "Add to PATH"

**"Connection error"**
